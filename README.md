Approaching the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner to Big Data Technologies

# What's BigBWA about? #

**BigBWA** is a tool to run [BWA][1] in a [Hadooop][2] cluster. **BigBWA** splits the [Fastq][3] input reads in pieces and process this pieces in parallel. For now, it supports the following BWA algorithms.

* **BWA-MEM**
* **BWA-ALN**
* **BWA-SW**

All of them work with paired and single reads.

Current version is 0.1.

# Structure #
In this GitHub repository we can find these directories:

* bwa - In this folder is where we put all the bwa versions software to build **BigBWA** against. Nowadays we include BWA versions 0.5.10-mt and 0.7.12, but, according with our development approach, **BigBWA** will work with later versions of BWA.
* libs - Here are the Hadoop libraries needed to build **BigBWA**. They are built for 64 bits. In the subdirectory 32 we can find the 32 bits libraries.
* src - The **BigBWA** source code.

You can find more info inside each one of the folders.

# Getting started #

## Requirements
To build **BigBWA**, requirements are the same than the ones to build bwa, with the only exception that you need to have defined the *JAVA_HOME* environment variables. If not, you can define it in file *Makefile.common*. 

The only thing we need to change for bwa is in its *Makefile*. For build **BigBWA** we need to create a shared library with bwa. For that, we have to add the *-fPIC* option to the files generated by bwa. To do this, the user just need to add this option to the end of the *CFLAGS* variable in bwa Makefile. For example, for bwa-0.7.12 previously was:

	CFLAGS=		-g -Wall -Wno-unused-function -O2

and after the change:

	CFLAGS=		-g -Wall -Wno-unused-function -O2 -fPIC

To build the jar file we are going to run in Hadoop, four hadoop jars are required. This jar files can be found inside libs folder. Depending on yout Hadoop installation you should use libs (for 64 bits) or libs/libs32 (for 32 bits). This also can be configured in *Makefile.common*.

## Building
Here follows an example of how to build **BigBWA**:

	git clone https://github.com/citiususc/BigBWA.git
	cd BigBWA
	make
		
This will generate *build* folder. Inside, we will find our two main files:

* **BigBWA.jar** - Jar file to launch in Hadoop.
* **bwa.zip** - File with the BWA library needed to run in Hadoop. It needs to be upload to the Hadoop distributed cache.

## Running BigBWA ##
To run **BigBWA** we need a working Hadoop cluster. Also, in this cluster, we need to ensure that we have available at least 9 GB of free memory per map, because each map is going to load into memory bwa index. We also need to take into account that **BigBWA** uses disk space in Hadoop tmp directory.

Here is an example of how to run **BigBWA** with BWA-MEM paired algorithm. This example assumes that our index is in all cluster nodes at */Data/HumanBase/* . The index can be obtained with bwa, using bwa index.

First we need to have input Fastq reads, we can get them from the 1000 Genomes project ftp.

	wget ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/NA12750/sequence_read/ERR000589_1.filt.fastq.gz
	wget ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/NA12750/sequence_read/ERR000589_2.filt.fastq.gz
	
Next we will uncompress these files:

	gzip -d ERR000589_1.filt.fastq.gz
	gzip -d ERR000589_2.filt.fastq.gz
	
After that, we need to use one of the Python tools in the utils folder:

	cd src/utils
	python Fq2FqBigDataPaired.py ../../ERR000589_1.filt.fastq ../../ERR000589_2.filt.fastq ../../ERR000589.fqBDP
	cd ../../
	
Then, we have to upload input data into HDFS:

	hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ERR000589.fqBDP ERR000589.fqBDP
	
And finally, we can run **BigBWA** in Hadoop:

	hadoop jar BigBWA.jar -archives bwa.zip -D mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize=123641127 -D mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.maxsize=123641127 -mem -paired -index /Data/HumanBase/hg19 -r ERR000589.fqBDP ExitERR000589

What we do with these options is:
* **-mem** - We indicate that we are going to use the mem algorithm.
* **-paired** - the algorithm is going to use paired reads.
* **-index** - We specify the index prefix after this parameter. The index mus be available in all the cluster nodes at the same location.
* **-r** - With this option we specify that we want to use a reducer.
* The last two arguments are the input and output in your HDFS.

If you want to check all the available options, you can execute the command:

	hadoop jar BigBWA.jar

After the execution, we can get the otput to the local filesystem by typing.

	mkdir Exit
	cd Exit 
	hdfs dfs -copyToLocal ExitERR000589/part-r-00000 ./
	cd ..
	
If we didn't use a reducer, the output will be splited in pieces. If we want to put it together we can use one of our Python utils or use samtools merge:

	mkdir Exit
	cd Exit 
	hdfs dfs -copyToLocal ExitERR000589/Output* ./
	cd ../src/utils
	python FullSam.py ../../Exit/ ../../Exit/OutputFile.sam
	cd ../../
	

##Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

1. [I can not build the tool because *jni_md.h* or *jni.h* is missing.](#building1)


####<a name="building1"></a>1. I can not build the tool because *jni_md.h* or *jni.h* is missing.
You need to set correctly your *JAVA_HOME* environment variable. You can set it in Makefile.common if you don't have it in your environment:

	JAVA_HOME = /usr/lib/jvm/java
