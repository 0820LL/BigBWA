# What's BigBWA about? #

**BigBWA** is a tool to run the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner--[BWA][1] on a [Hadoop][2] cluster. The current version of BigBWA (2.1, november 2016) supports the following BWA algorithms:

* **BWA-MEM**
* **BWA-backtrack**
* **BWA-SW**

All of them work with paired and single-end reads.

If you use **BigBWA**, please cite this article:

A version for [Apache Spark][6] is available [here][7].

# Structure #
Since version 2.0 the project keeps a standard Maven structure. The source code is in the *src/main* folder. Inside it, we can find two subfolders:

* **java** - Here is where the Java code is stored.
* **native** - Here the BWA native code (C) and the glue logic for JNI is stored.

# Getting started #

## Requirements
Requirements to build **BigBWA** are the same than the ones to build BWA, with the only exception that the *JAVA_HOME* environment variable should be defined. If not, you can define it in the */src/main/native/Makefile.common* file. 

It is also needed to include the flag *-fPIC* in the *Makefile* of the considered BWA version. To do this, the user just need to add this option to the end of the *CFLAGS* variable in the BWA Makefile. Considering bwa-0.7.15, the original Makefile contains:

	CFLAGS=		-g -Wall -Wno-unused-function -O2

and after the change it should be:

	CFLAGS=		-g -Wall -Wno-unused-function -O2 -fPIC

Additionaly, and as **BigBWA** is built with Maven since version 0.2, also have it in the user computer is needed.

## Building
The default way to build **BigBWA** is:

	git clone https://github.com/citiususc/BigBWA.git
	cd BigBWA
	mvn package
		
This will create the *target* folder, which will contain the *jar* file needed to run **BigBWA**:

* **BigBWA-2.1.jar** - jar file to launch with Hadoop.

## Configuring
Since version 2.0 there is no need of configuring any Hadoop parameter. The only requirement is that the YARN containers need to have at least 7500MB of memory available (for the human genome case).

## Running BigBWA ##
**BigBWA** requires a working Hadoop cluster. Users should take into account that at least 7500MB of free memory per map are required (each map loads into memory the bwa index). Note that **BigBWA** uses disk space in the Hadoop *tmp* directory.

Here it is an example of how to run **BigBWA** using the BWA-MEM paired algorithm. This example assumes that our index is stored in all the cluster nodes at */Data/HumanBase/* . The index can be obtained with BWA, using "bwa index".

First, we get the input Fastq reads from the [1000 Genomes Project][3] ftp:

	wget ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/NA12750/sequence_read/ERR000589_1.filt.fastq.gz
	wget ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data/NA12750/sequence_read/ERR000589_2.filt.fastq.gz
	
Next, the downloaded files should be uncompressed:

	gzip -d ERR000589_1.filt.fastq.gz
	gzip -d ERR000589_2.filt.fastq.gz
	
and prepared to be used by BigBWA:

	python src/utils/Fq2FqBigDataPaired.py ERR000589_1.filt.fastq ERR000589_2.filt.fastq ERR000589.fqBD

	hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal ERR000589.fqBDP ERR000589.fqBDP
	
Finally, we can execute **BigBWA** on the Hadoop cluster:

	yarn jar BigBWA-2.1.jar com.github.bigbwa.BigBWA -D mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize=123641127
	-D mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.maxsize=123641127
	-D mapreduce.map.memory.mb=7500
	-w "-R @RG\tID:foo\tLB:bar\tPL:illumina\tPU:illumina\tSM:ERR000589 -t 2"
	-m -p --index /Data/HumanBase/hg19 -r ERR000589.fqBDP ExitERR000589

Options:

* **-m** - Sequence alignment algorithm.
* **-p** - Use paired-end reads.
* **-w "args"** - Can be used to pass arguments directly to BWA (ex. "-t 4" to specify the amount of threads to use per instance of BWA).
* **--index index_prefix** - Index prefix is specified. The index must be available in all the cluster nodes at the same location.
* The last two arguments are the input and output HDFS files.


If you want to check all the available options, execute the command:

	yarn jar BigBWA-2.1.jar com.github.bigbwa.BigBWA -h
	
The commands are:

      -m, --mem                                        The MEM algorithm will be used
    
    Index options: 
      -i, --index <Index prefix>                       Prefix for the index created by bwa to use - setIndexPath(string)
    
    Spark options: 
      -n, --partitions <Number of partitions>          Number of partitions to divide input - setPartitionNumber(int)
    
    Reducer options: 
      -r, --reducer                                    The program is going to merge all the final results in a reducer phase
    
    BWA arguments options: 
      -w, --bwa <"BWA arguments">                      Arguments passed directly to BWA


After the execution, to move the output to the local filesystem use: 

	hdfs dfs -copyToLocal ExitERR000589/part-r-00000 ./
	
In case there is no reducer, the output will be split into several pieces. In order to put it together users could use one of our Python utils or "samtools merge":

	hdfs dfs -copyToLocal ExitERR000589/Output* ./
	python src/utils/FullSam.py ./ ./OutputFile.sam

You need to set correctly your *JAVA_HOME* environment variable or you can set it in Makefile.common.
