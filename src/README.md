# src folder #

In this folder we have the source code of **BigBWA**.

### utils ###
In the utils folder we have put some utilities usefull to the final user.

### BigBWA.java ###
This is the main file of **BigBWA**. Here we parse the user options and call bwa methods from Hadoop.

### BwaJni.h ###
This file is automatically generated by the *javah* command. Is the header where native methods that are going do be called from Java are defined. The code for these methods is in file *bwa_jni.c*.

### BwaJni.java ###
This file is where we define the Java methods that call bwa. Also, from this file is from we generate *BwaJni.h* by typing:

	javac BwaJni.java
	javah BwaJni
	
### BwaSeq.java ###
Actually, this file is not needed to run **BigBwa**. It is just a file to tes the calls to bwa library in sequential mode. After build the program, you can test if these calls are made just by typing from the *build* dir:

	java -Djava.library.path=. -jar BigBWASeq.jar bwa mem index_prefix input output
	
### bwa_jni.c ###
This is the native code executed from Java. Here we parse the Java arguments and convert them into C arguments. After that, we call main method of bwa with this arguments. Also we do a redirection from standard output to files.
